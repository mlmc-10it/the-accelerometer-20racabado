# The Accelerometer on a Microbit Introduction
What I have learned throughout this entire process of the Accelerometer on the microbit is that you can do it through a different methods. For one you can use just the blocks which are very simple quite full on easier to use and understand the idea of inputing the many different specific functions that can alter the operation of the microbit. Then it outputs the result from what you delivered via the code. Despite using the simple method of using blocks and picking the functions that can easily operate the microbit, you can use Python Code which is more of a professional way to enable the functions of the microcontroller.
