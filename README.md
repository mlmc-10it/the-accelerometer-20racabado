Tasks for learning physical computing with the microbit
# Physical computing refers to building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world.

Micontroller 
A microcontroller is a compact and small sized integrated circuit that governs a specific operation in the embedded system 
Here is a list of the different types of microcontrollers
*  Arduino <br>

Sensors
Sensors refers to a device that detects or measures a physical property that is analysed in some sort of fashion, examples of sensors is that it is used to read any movement which is then trasported to the device.
Here is a list of the different types of censors 
* Motion Sensors <br>
