Tasks for learning physical computing with the microbit
# Physical computing refers to building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world.

Microcontrollers: Are a compact and small sized integrated circuit that governs a specific operation in the embedded system 
Here is a list of the different types of microcontrollers
*  Arduino <br>

Sensors: A sensor refers to a device that detects or measures a physical property that is analysed in some sort of fashion, examples of sensors is that it is used to read any movement which is then trasported to the device.
Here is a list of the different types of censors 
* Motion Sensors <br>

Actuator:An Actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving a mechanism or system 
Here are examples of an Actuator 
* Electrical Motors <br>

Software: Software refers to programs and other operating information used by computer
Here are different types of software

Analog and Digital Signals: The difference between these terminologies is that they both have different characteristics. The Analog Signal has continous values which represents Physical measurements the Digital is discrete time signals generated by digital modulation. Another difference is that analog is based on the real world environment and the digital is more of a computerised world. Example of Analog elements are based on Human voice in air and analog electronic devices and Digital is more preferably correlated to Computers, CDs, Dvds and other electrionic digital devices. 

Fantasy Device: An idea of a fantasy device is hi tech glasses, but only they are used to withstand the sunlight but it has specific functions. This concept combines the idea of Tony Stark's suit and the google glass, however these are fused to create something evolutionary. When wearing the special shades, it can detect the real world environment, accurately through some sort of signal built inside the device. Which can also be used as communicating with the AI voice bot, which you can also build a relationship that could guide you through your needs. Like saying hi, how are you etc. Then when you remove it, it will not be discrete, which it has speakers somewhere at the sides which you can use to use it for an alarm unless if there is a software that can control the device via bluethooth.
