# Compass 

# What I've learned
When operating the microbit with a compass, it was more of a challenging aspect of using the device. The reason why it requires two different codes however with one simple and one, somewhat slighty advanced, the purpose of this code is that it outputs a direction to where you are situated from. Like say for example you are clearly vague from where you are, but when you use a compass, it indicates your location and what point you are positioned in. Like from North, South, East or West
