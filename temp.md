# Temperature in a Microbit

What I've learned about using the Thermometer in a Microbit is that the results can vary depending on the environments you're surrounded in.
The significance of operating a thermostat on a microcontroller is that it can be manipulated in many ways where as the temperature can often output with different results.
When operating the thermostat, it shows the temperature in Celsius then transitions and returns, however if you blow on the microcontroller, the results change when it comes to the temperature
