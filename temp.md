# Temperature in a Microbit

What I've learned about using the Thermometer in a Microbit is that the results can vary depending on the environments you're surrounded in.
The significance of operating a thermostat on a microcontroller is that it can be manipulated in many ways where as the temperature can often output with different results.
When operating the thermostat, it shows the temperature in Celsius then transitions and returns, however if you blow on the microcontroller, the results change when it comes to the temperature. This could refer to the digital world which it can detect analog environments then reads out the information through the device. However themrostats are tethered to homes that are for heaters or airconditioners which you can change the temperature for your house to become hot or cold. Another lesson I've learned is that the coding for this challenge requires the python method more than the simple and blocky one.

# Here is the code 








# What does it do?

Finding a temperature in a thermostat is just like measuring the weather happening outside or somewhere in the environment, many meterologists use these types of methods to detect the estimated weather which is repeated which then it is announced to the public for the weather. Thermostats are although used for the purpose of manipulating the temperature of an environment, it is always to be built for that particular purpose which can benefit many houses having at least one of them that outputs the heating from room to room.
